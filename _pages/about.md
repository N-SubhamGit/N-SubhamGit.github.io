I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Mathematics at **IISER Thiruvananthapuram**, specializing in Numerical Analysis. My research, under the supervision of **Dr. Asha Kisan Dond**, focuses on the Convergence of Adaptive Finite Element Methods for a class of Optimal Control Problems governed by Biharmonic Equations.

#### Research Interests
* **Finite Element Methods (FEM):** Mixed FEM and Stabilized methods.
* **Adaptive FEM:** Convergence and optimality.
* **Optimization:** PDE-constrained optimization problems.
* **Singularly Perturbed PDEs:** Robust numerical schemes for convection-diffusion problems.

I recently submitted my thesis (2025) and am currently exploring postdoctoral opportunities in numerical analysis and scientific computing.
